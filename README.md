# Cod4 cdkey changer

This is an attempt to restore a very old project that has been lost during the years.

This project was released in late 2007 then revamped when vs2010 first come out.

Some notable features:
* Online cdkey validation using a fake cod4 server
* Show you if the key is valid online (green) valid offline (yellow) or invalid (red)
* Detect the current cdkey from the registry (no longer works for w8+)
* Store your personal cdkey
* Show the cdkey pbguid (superusefull for clanbase ecc...)
* Hide the last 13 character of the cdkey until you press shift to reveal them
* Inject the cdkey whitout close the game (you can insta rejoin a server after you have been banned)
